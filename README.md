# tip-tracker
Web app I made for my wife and her co-workers to keep track of their tips at work

(The commit history looks like it all came out of nowhere because I was working with my wife's tip history in a private repository while building the app and didn't want that data publically visible. Once I got her history loaded into localStorage on her phone and confirmed everything was working,I was able to remove the private data and push to this new public repository.)
